# MazeGame

Simple game meant for introduction to unity.
After the lecture the kids should have a cool game to take home with them.

The kids should work from the scene labelled "lvl0" and then delete blocks to make a maze.
They can then place eggs, cannons, monsters and killWalls around the level to make it challenging.
The killWall is missing a script to make it kille the player. Either write a new script with the kids
or place the script "killBlock" on the wall.
